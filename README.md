# aoc-2021

Advent of Code 2021 -- highly optimized Rust solutions.

There's a lot of unsafe code, all kinds of bit hackery, and SIMD (since it uses portable-simd crate,
it can currently only compile on nightly). The main goal was to try and squeeze out as much performance
as possible, both via using smart non-bruteforce algorithms when applicable, and by making full use
of the hardware (be it SIMD or parallelisation). Most problems except a few run a single thread though.

These are the benchmark results taken on Apple M1 laptop (these include the time to parse input for
each part of each problem - there are no input 'generators' and so each input is parsed twice):

Quick notes on solutions to some of the problems that were less trivial (the problems that
are not mentioned were straightforward):

- Day 5: part 1 is a simple orthogonal line sweep. Part 2 uses a modified version of line
  sweep algorithm where the scanline is vertical and there are separate active sets for
  all three types of lines (horizontal and both diagonal types).
- Day 9: uses SIMD to speed up part 1. Part 2 is a known problem (4-CCL for binary images),
  so a union-find algorithm can be employed.
- Day 12: uses a cache when traversing the graph; also, in part 1 simplifies the graph by 
  removing some irrelevant nodes that have a single edge leading to a small cave.
- Day 18: exploits the fact that there can be no split operations until there's at least
  one explode, so everything is unrolled in two passes; the first pass is explodes-only
  and in the second pass we process the splits inline.
- Day 19: uses the fact that an unambiguous solution for a pair of scanners is guaranteed
  if there's a 12-point overlap; only L2 pairwise distances between beacons are used to
  find matching sets - then we build a connectivity graph between scanners.
- Day 20: naive solution; planned to optimize it via SIMD but haven't had time to finish.
- Day 21: classic bottom-up 5-D dynamic programming.
- Day 22: one of the most non-trivial solutions - used the fact that overlaps of different
  cardinality can be found by enumerating cliques of the overlap graph; ported and modified
  networkx clique finding algorithm to make it work (surprisingly, it ended up being fast).
- Day 23: track minimum possible remaining cost for all moves, use compact data structures
  and run DFS with some heuristics (try to select worst moves for A) and cost tracking.
- Day 24: relies on the specific structure of the input (stack machine).
- Day 25: used SIMD, ghost cells and lookup tables to speed it up (this is the BML traffic model).
